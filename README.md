# R book template

A quarto project template to use for courses and other documentation separated from the main BlueGreen Labs website

To make sure that the template works "out of the box" you will have to include all branches (click the tick box which isn't marked by default).

If you forgot to tick the box you will need to run the `quarto publish gh-pages` command in a CLI terminal (not the R terminal).
